Integral function with the power of the dependent variable(x) multiplying that of the exponential function of that dependent variable(x) to the second power having an odd powers i.e ranging from x=1,2,3,5…. or an even powers i.e ranging from x=0,2,4,6… Have a general formular called the Anekwe’s integral Formular.

Introduction The motive behind this research article is to derive a formula that can be able to solve integral fuctions involving exponential functions of x to the second power in connection to the product of its dependable variable x of a certain degree, and to compare its result obtained with results obtained when solved using gamma function. Example, like in the case of finding the gamma function of half (1/2) which is equal to the square-root of pie, also to solve other complex integrals of the famous bell shaped curve of probability theory, and later applying the same integrals derived in solving problems in statistical and thermal physics in terms of the speed and energy of a given particle in motion. The Gamma function is defined by an improper integral function which provides a way of giving a meaning to the “factorial” of any positive real number. Another reason for interest in the gamma function is its relation to integrals that arise in the study of probability. The graph of the function ϕ defined by ϕ(x) = e −x 2 is the famous “bell-shaped curve” of probability theory. It can be shown that the anti-derivatives of ϕ are not expressible in terms of elementary functions.

Methodology In this section we shall consider how to of integrate the product of a dependable variable (x) of a certain degree from Negative infinity to positive infinity together with an exponential function of that dependent variable(x) to the second degree and apply the results obtained from these integrals in solving problems relating to speed and energy of a particle in motion in statistical and thermal physics.
